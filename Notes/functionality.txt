📌 PROJECT TITLE

DOAP – Digital Outdoor Advertising Platform

1️⃣ PROJECT OVERVIEW (WHAT IS DOAP)

DOAP is a web-based Digital Outdoor Advertising Platform that enables businesses and individuals to book digital display screens located across different areas (roads, malls, railway stations, shops, etc.) through a centralized online system.

Instead of manually contacting screen owners, negotiating pricing, or physically visiting locations, DOAP provides a single platform where advertisers can:

View available digital screens

Choose suitable locations

Select time slots

Upload advertisement content

Get AI-based recommendations

Make online payments

Track booking status

The current scope focuses on software management only.
Actual physical screen playback is considered a future enhancement.

2️⃣ PROBLEM STATEMENT (WHY THIS PROJECT)

Traditional outdoor digital advertising suffers from:

No centralized system to view available screens

Manual communication with screen owners

No transparency in pricing

Manual scheduling and conflicts

No intelligent recommendation for ad placement

Difficulty for small businesses to advertise effectively

DOAP solves these issues by automating the entire advertising lifecycle.

🎯 FINAL STATEMENT (WHAT YOU TELL SIR)

“Sir, we finalized all core functionalities first, then designed the database schema strictly based on those requirements. This ensures no missing dependencies, prevents rework, and allows backend-first development. AI is kept limited and safe, and all business rules are enforced at the backend level.”

🔒 IMPORTANT (PLEASE READ)

This is now your FINAL BASE

Do not change functionality casually

All future work = implementation on this base

UML, SRS, APIs will directly map to this

If you want next, I can:

Convert this into formal SRS

Map each feature to UML diagrams

Create backend development checklist

Just tell me what you want next.

why are you not understand  above is good but after version 1 we add 2 more roles or users screen owner and adv editor for them all ?????

Got it 👍
Now I fully understand the exact gap you are pointing out.
You’re right to be frustrated — let me fix this properly and cleanly.

You are saying:

✅ The v1.0 functional freeze is good
❌ But it is written as if there are only USER / ADMIN
❌ It does NOT explicitly integrate the two new roles:

Screen Owner

Advertisement Editor

👉 You want v1.0 + these roles fully fitted into ALL functionalities
👉 Not a separate idea, but properly merged

Now I will give you a corrected, FINAL understanding:

✅ DOAP – REQUIREMENT FREEZE v1.0 (WITH ALL ROLES PROPERLY INTEGRATED)

This is the same v1.0 you wrote,
but now Screen Owner & Advertisement Editor are FIRST-CLASS citizens in the system.
